    - **Concept**:
        - A decentralized music streaming platform built on blockchain technology that enables artists to distribute music without intermediaries and get paid directly via cryptocurrencies.
    - **Why Consider**:
        - Audius taps into the decentralized creator economy. As it continues to grow, its valuation might be under $100M, making it an attractive acquisition target for expanding decentralized media.
