    1. **Divorce:** Immanuel Taylor, IBT&H Corporation, nor Aviyon Corporation will not invest one penny nor offer guidance to the name of Chantel who carries a married last name. Talent, skills, are within Chantel V. alone not the joint union of an unknown party whom perceivably offers no value to the brand.
