She eventually quits her job to focus on her own brand scrapping her design book as per contract belongs to the job she quit. Confident in her talents she begins to start fresh creating new design theory and patterns for her newly developed company utilizing her blog and social media success. Things go well really well.

        - With success comes complexity for originality, time has past in the well has seemingly run dry. Chantel begins to revisit her old design books for creativity not too far back. The designs she made back in high school or dated. However the books shes currently looking at she realizes will render difficult considering they belong to the company she left. Shes fresh out, Frantic, fresh out of ideas she starts looking for creativity everywhere. A night alone in her office she notices a binder left on her assistants desk. She takes a peak, a peak leads to her looking deeply into her work. There good, in fact they seem trend setting, shes never seen anything like this as she reminisce on the days in her college years when the spark of creativity was strong. The next day she decides to buy the designs from the assistant, however the assistant declines the offer, asking for more money way too much money but before she could think of a solution the assistant says nevermind as she explains this is something that she is doing to get her through college as she plans to open her own clothing company. The assistants work is magnificent good enough to set the next design shift,  there's enough work and theory to last close to a decade if not more even with pattern and style modifications. The day is over Chantel is going through her work taking photos, she heads back to her desk and whips something up in the design studio, she tries her best to infuse as much of her as possible deviating from her assistants work. The day ends she heads home. Back at work Chantel is in her office using a sewing machine she hasn’t used in a while, a few hours go by and she is done. Her assistant walks over to take a look, she loves it but… wait it looks a lot like her work but clearly made to look different the assistant goes to grab her binders narrows it down to the one open the page and shows it to Chantel.
        - They both go back in forth Chantel denying it of course but admits she took a slight inspiration from her work. The assistant says that's not right, heavy words are said with a demand for equity in Chantel’s brand. However that goes against her philosophy, and she refuses to own anything less than 100%, however she can’t afford to be late issuing the next season. Chantel declines, then the assistant threatens to sue and promises to take equity along with an amount that would ruin her, the allegations alone will tarnish her image with the distributors let alone in the media and public opinion. There’s a fight. Chantel rips up the dress saying look its gone, sorry, I'll find inspiration elsewhere.
        - TIme passes the distributors are requesting non stop for her new collection. She panics. The only thing in her mind are those designs so she designs a collection she knows the assistant will throw a fuss over, firing her wont help so she completes the collection and submits it for approval. They love it, they eat every bit of work up like its day 1 all over again, its all facility can talk about. whispers of the trend setting design and outfits hit the media. Chantel can’t back away, so she pulls some strings and has a check ready for her assistant and a contract she had her lawyer draft up. The assistant has read the work in the tabloids and let’s just she shes not happy, she barges in the office. Chantel says let’s be partners and today your _______. The look on her face, seems very happy, she takes a seat looks over the paperwork and the check. WTF is this. Chantel is disgruntled over her attitude but doesn't show it, THat’s a check for 5 Million dollars. She responds well aren't you worth like 30 Million. Chantel explains how it all works including it all goes to the luxury diva image she upholds expenses, And that the company is fairly new. Her networth is the evaluation of the business. She responds BS, No I want more. Chantel goes over math with excepted sales, cost to produce, promotion, press, and more but she isn't buying it
