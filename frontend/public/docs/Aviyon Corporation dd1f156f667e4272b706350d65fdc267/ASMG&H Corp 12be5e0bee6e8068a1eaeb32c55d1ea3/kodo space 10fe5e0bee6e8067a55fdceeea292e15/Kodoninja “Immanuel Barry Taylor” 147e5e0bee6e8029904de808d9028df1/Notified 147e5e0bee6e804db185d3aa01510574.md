        - A female assassin unofficially hired by Abu Dhabi (UAE) similar to “Taskranbbit”. She becomes a target of a foreign alliance of the USA, thus Taskrabbit is tasked with her elimination, tracked down they eventually fight near death taking 4% of the city of ____ down with them to eventually end in a aggressive sex scene to end in the two resuming to yet again end up in bed together. They eventually come up with a plan for Taskrabbit to talk to the hirer into dropping the hit against Ballerina or defect. Although the USA has a habit of eliminating defects who alter or defect on missions. the legendary taskrabbit cannot afford to be lost, so he is then reordered to target another as Ballerinas connects & assets may be of better use alive then dead. A joint union of agencies is in consideration as Ballerina has promised to figure out.
