No mission or details were shared with her friend, she had no ID (kept in Safety deposits around the world) only that she needed to get back in shape and return to her work, (after all his boss is a ghost, no Nation knows exist) which he assumed was a fighter of sorts, due to the fact she was eager to get in shape to fight underground.
