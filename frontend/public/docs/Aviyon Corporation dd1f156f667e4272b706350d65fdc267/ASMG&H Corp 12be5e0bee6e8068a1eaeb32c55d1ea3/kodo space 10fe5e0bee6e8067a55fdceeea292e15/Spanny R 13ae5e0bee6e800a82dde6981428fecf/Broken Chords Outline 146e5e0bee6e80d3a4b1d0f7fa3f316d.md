    - There's a group of band members looking to make it big in there rented garage space. They practice 7 days a week, 12 hours a day with very few breaks, with gigs here and there. During practice the lead singer gets fed up slams the mic, stating this isn’t working, “the sound, you know, the sound just isn’t right”… They eventually decide on getting a new lead singer to justify there urge of a different sound, something feminine and powerful to match there indie alternative sound. The search is underway, a few girls show up, but nothing’s perfect. 6 girls have tried out and the sound is all off. The current lead singer is drinking at a bar taken the edge of during a trip to visits his grandparents home. It’s there he notices a attractive girl taking the stage. And so it happens, that’s the sound they’ve been looking for, he stares at her she locks eyes with him and it’s as if she’s singing to him. The song is over she goes to go sit down, he heads over to the girl they began to conversate he orders her a drink. They conversate back in forth for what seems to be like for hours about his band her singing, and how she’ll be a good fit. She initiates you wanna get out of here, he responds yeah. There back at her home they have sex. A few days go by and she decides to leave to LA to go try out for the band.
    - When introduced to the other band band member Lenny, he seem to like her, there’s immediate spark, she likes his hair, complements his body, goes on for a while about it. The lead singer pulls them apart and says “grab center we’ll back you in,… here take this sheet follow along to the ques” She grabs the sheet puts it on the stand, adjusts the mic and its electric pure & divine the best sound they could ask for the best sound period. She’s perfect.  The song is over she turns and looks back at Lenny & Colin “how was I?” Unanimous yea, hell yes, your in. The lead singer “So it’s settled your moving here to LA?” “Yeah, I'll have my roommates send over my stuff as soon as I find a place. The lead singer offers a room and his apartment, she accepts. She eventually is all moved in time goes by practice is going on as usual 7 days a week, 12 hours a day, until the guitarist makes a suggestion. “So I think we should record an album, yay, nay?” They all agree. Soon the guys began buying some sound proofing gear for the garage, and a few extra equipment they’ll be needing.
    - As time progress the chemistry between (Spanny) & Lenny grows as she casually dates Colin. The band is doing great really great Colin has a gig lined up to play there song “brown eye’s” so they practice until then non stop. During a break (Spanny) casually ask
    - Spanny: “So how is it that you two can afford all this nice equipment?”
    - Colin: “we both chip in, but Lenny’s been doing a bit of trading during the day”..
    - Spanny: “Oh really, how’s that?”
    - Lenny: “Good, I lose a lot!, but I do make just enough for rent and my apartment, Although we’d have more money for better equipment, if moved back in my van”
    - Colin: “”better” its all top of line”
    - Lenny: “Yeah, but not the best in line”
    - Spanny: “Well, its all in the talent anyway, but the best group needs the best equipment I guess”
    - Lenny: “Exactly!”
    - Spanny: “So you Trade, and you used to be a van lifer?”
    - Lenny: “Used to be, nah, well still am kinda”
    - Spanny: “So hows that work?”

    - Spanny: “No!, trading, how does it work? I mean I have a few friends who do it but I’ve never tried it”
    - Lenny: “Come to my apartment tomorrow at 6am, i’ll show you”
    - Spanny: “I’ll take you up on that”
    - Lenny: “Then you can show me how you get your abs so deep”

His heart races out of control, her perfume, her body, no brah nipples are erect for days. Lenny is rock hard at this point where his dick is coming out of his shorts Spanny is basically penetrated through her skirt as she wiggles deeper on it. Heart racing Lenny goes over trading as best as he could fighting for dear life to stay focused. He eventually make a trade, and she is with him 100% never loosing focus. They both look at the trade then Lenny’s eyes move back down her shirt.
    - Unable to control himself Lenny puts his hands on her abs reaches up her crop top and plays with her breast and nipples. Spanny says nothing but moans, Lennys dick is rock hard and getting thicker. Spanny starts to grind on his cock while pushing her panties to the side. She pulls up his left shorts to reveal Lenny’s penis and its entirety. She continues to grind as Lenny plays with her nipples. Moaning continues Lenny can feel vaginal fluid dripping from her vagina onto his cock. This only makes him harder. Then she starts to stroke his dick while it sits directly in front of her, she eventually spits on hi cock gets up and starts to slide down on his dick.
