            - In the year 2085 not to distant from present day. Cars & bikes are still road bound, commuter air taxis, mid travel flying vehicles, modern planes are the method of travel. We have traditional cities with AI, AR, & VR implemented into daily life with one taboo practice seem as mythicial and unreal. These are the existence and taboo practice of mechanizing humans. A practice first introduced in 2034 in a world of longevity methods, head swaps, and brain uploading for VR and robotics. Although mostly seen as rare dangerious and unsuccessful little was known as the ones who actually achieved success. Companies fearful of redicil and backlash escaped the US and preformed there research, transfers and surgeries in the privacy of foreign soils. Some call them enhancers but they do walk among us and more quantities than first thought. Once exclusive to the ultra wealthy, grew copycats that lowered cost to almost free for those crazy enough to risk their lives for the chance of being test subjects for trials of companies with offshore hidden research facilities with billions in funding. If you seen a sex doll, you’d know that seeing an enhancer is no different, they even walk like norms with better balance, strength, agility, speed well you get it. Life isn’t so perfect for they need to keep being maintained, or else issues arise like the decay. It was late 2085 when the outbreak happened. A month before that a bizzare weaponized strain from 2019 resurfaced as it was released in the West coast of USA on accident from a bird that escaped a researched facility in North Korea. It wasn’t that big of a deal a shots were administered for free for everyone. A month later several countries were put on another lockdown similar to 2019-2020.
            - Present day November 9th 2085: The weaponized strain had mutated and began to kill the host at a much slower rate than 2019 due to all the decades of vaccines. When the dead were dead well they seem to be moving, reacting to stimuli like sound, light and the heat emitting from your blood within your body drawn to other humans like a blood bug. Not blood itself but the blood heated from your living body. Today TV updates, and news information is scarce due to the blood seekers. When the dead host bite the living within a few hours they are dead blood seekers. We try to keep each other updated with modern communication but that is growing scarce. The blood seekers, can’t seem to stop unless their brain is peirced with a sharp object.
            - Remember those enhancers, well they seem to have some sort of mineral oil that’s red and has to be heated like a car. Those blood seekers don’t know the difference so they attack the norms just the same as the enhancers. It’s not what you think, when there bit yes bit through there 3D printed skin it speeds the decay. The norms have hours, the enhancers have days if not a week. Which means in a fallen society the enhancers must swap bodies via download or seek a enhancer research lab. They can be saved, but not norms. However good luck finding a enhancer research facility and a world over ran by blood seekers.
            - Note
                - The weaponized strain that outbroke by a single bird from North Korea to the US was originally designed to weaken the enhancers in the US military, for an eventual world war that never came to be.
                    - Strain was still in development and unfinished, that’s why it’s so slow
                - The makeup of a enhancer consist of a humanoid metallic bone like material 10xs stronger than human bone. The blood is a synthetic oil colored red to maintain the body’s complete functionality. It’s design was to completely past the turing test to past as human considering the brain of its human was still kept or downloaded to a synthetic brain as most billionaires choose to do. The muscle fibers are 3D printed and moved by a synthetic nervous system and signals sent from it’s synthetic brain or human brain. Hair, skin, eyes, ethniticty and any other aspect was typically designed to clone the originals exact deminsions with the occasional over exhalations as requested such as facial and body apperance, penis size, muscle definition in males and breast size and slim figures in females and so forth.
                    - Sex with enhancers and humans are very plausible as again meant to completely past as human. Signals of dopamine are sent to its chosen brain and millions of synthetic nerve endings are used to feel every aspect of sexual intercourse. The bodies does not ejaculate nor do the females give birth.
                    - Food is unnecessary, and optional just as liquid. The bodies do excrete waste via urine and solid waste just as humans. No nutrients are absorbed just packaged compressed and excreted if solid, or passed through its uniry system if liquid. Food and nuristment do not offer a function but taste and the feeling of being human with other norms. Eating does not damage nor cause any performance obstructions, just flush with 50/50 water and synthetic oil often repacked to avoid questioning by spouse etc. designed to be non toxic to humans under accidental dosses.
                    - The weight of an enhancer is not much different as within 50lbs due to the skeleton hardening.
                - The decay will normally consume a enhancers life in 5 years without maintance. However when bit by blood seekers they only last days if not a week.
                - Although enhancer facilities are typically seen outside the US. There are sevrel hidden locations throughout the US.
                - Found locations can be used to scan current bodies and print out and build new bodies for download swap.
                - The process of mechanizing was close to making itself world legal as success after successful trials and military usage became more common.
                - There is no cure for humans, or androids however enhancers can swap or slow down the decay.
