        > *Quote from Kodoninja:* I don‚Äôt take steroids but I spend hundreds a month on fitness and diet. Including millions on doctors, dermatologist performance enhancing stem cells, nanites, cryo and oxygen chambers. I‚Äôm a border line super soldier. If I went all in who am I to condemn those who do
