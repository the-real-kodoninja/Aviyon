Arms are to be trained daily to match the physical of your legs, limbs should be identical in performance, regardless of what someone says on what muscle groups have larger muscles….. Your legs are larger because you train them every fucking day. A baby’s legs & arms are identical nearly into they start to walk developing there legs… An apes arms are proportional to there legs…..
