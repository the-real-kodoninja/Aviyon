            - acquisition
                - As 10 -47 Billion remains liquid use the dividend compounded interest to acquire other companies with credit borrowed against assets
                - As stock from public companies surge sell to acquire with above method
                - This should essentially get companies for near free
            - year 1 may not be a cash lost year due to the 10 - 45 Billion in liquid. In addition the revenue made from acquisitions with liquid dividends should create a cash + year breaking above even… If not above breaking even the lost in acquisition will be absorbed and lost will be light making up the following 2 quarters next year.
            - year 1 acquisition will not use borrowed money, nor credit strictly cash
            - two company max with borrowed money until paid off.
                - the goodness of debt will be utilized differently
