      <div class="prose max-w-none text-text-light dark:text-text-light text-text-light-light">
        <p>Aviyon began as a visionary cloud platform, merging seamless development, deployment, and hosting, drawing inspiration from giants like Heroku, Hostinger, and Codeanywhere.</p>
        <p>It evolved into a cyberpunk coding saga, thrusting developers into a sleek dystopia of high-stakes missions and clandestine networks, inspired by <em>Ghost in the Shell</em>'s haunting blend of technology and humanity.</p>
        <p>This transformation spawned <strong>nimbus.ai</strong>, an AI-driven titan pursuing Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) to tackle humanity's grandest challenges and redefine existence.</p>
        <p>Aviyon is part of the expansive <strong>kodoverse ecosystem</strong>, including projects like KodoCity, kodoanime.social, DeFiScraper, stoploss, and whale, weaving a vibrant virtual cosmos where code and reality converge.</p>
